As '''Napoleon I''', he was [[Emperor of the French]] from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European affairs for over a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, rapidly gaining control of continental Europe before his ultimate defeat in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide and he remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history.<ref name=\\\"Roberts, Andrew 2014\\\">Roberts, Andrew.

Serving in the French army as an artillery officer, Napoleon supported the Revolution from the outset in 1789 and tried to spread its ideals to Corsica, but was banished from the island in 1793. Two years later, he saved the French government from collapse by firing on the Parisian mobs with cannons, an event known as the ''[[13 Vend\\u00e9miaire]]''. The [[French Directory|Directory]] then appointed him as General of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] at age 26. After marrying [[Jos\\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]] in 1796, he began his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|first military campaign]] against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring a series of decisive victories that made him famous all across Europe. In 1798 he commanded a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|military expedition to Egypt]], conquering the Ottoman province after [[Battle of the Pyramids|defeating the Mamelukes]] and launching modern [[Egyptology]] through the [[Rosetta Stone|discoveries]] made by his army.\\n\\nThe Directory collapsed when Napoleon and his supporters engineered a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup in November 1799]]. He was installed as ''First Consul'' of the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and gradually extended his political control over France. With the [[Concordat of 1801]], Napoleon restored the religious powers of the Catholic Church but retained its landed wealth in the hands of the French state. He also signed the short-lived [[Treaty of Amiens]] with the British in 1802, ending the Revolutionary Wars. The [[S\\u00e9nat conservateur|Senate]] eventually declared him the ''Emperor of the French'' in 1804, setting the stage for the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Intractable differences with the British meant the French were facing a [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the [[Ulm Campaign]] and a historic triumph at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], which led to the elimination of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]]. In October 1805, however, a Franco-Spanish fleet was destroyed at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], allowing Britain to impose a naval blockade of the French coasts. In retaliation, Napoleon established the [[Continental System]] in 1806 to cut off European trade with Britain. The [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]] took up arms against him the same year because Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent. After quickly knocking out Prussia at the [[Battle of Jena\\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], Napoleon turned his attention towards the Russians and annihilated them in 1807 at the [[Battle of Friedland]]. Friedland forced the Russians to accept the [[Treaties of Tilsit]], the high water mark of the French Empire.\\n\\nHoping to extend the Continental System, Napoleon invaded [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and declared his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The [[Peninsular War]], noted for its brutal [[guerrilla warfare]], lasted six years and culminated in an Allied victory over the French. Fighting also erupted in Central Europe as the Austrians launched another attack against the French in 1809. Napoleon defeated them at the [[Battle of Wagram]], dissolving the [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Fifth Coalition]] formed against France. After the [[Treaty of Sch\\u00f6nbrunn]] in the fall of 1809, he divorced Josephine and married Austrian princess [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] in 1810. By 1811, Napoleon ruled over 70 million people across an empire that had domination in Europe, which had not witnessed this level of political consolidation since the days of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\\\"Roberts\\\">Roberts, A. ''Napoleon: A Life''. Penguin Group, 2014, p. 457.</ref> He maintained his strategic status through a series of alliances and family appointments. He created a new aristocracy in France while allowing for the return of nobles who had been forced into exile by the Revolution.\\n\\nEscalating tensions over rising Polish nationalism and the economic effects of the Continental System led to renewed confrontation with Russia. To enforce his blockade, Napoleon launched an [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in 1812 that ended in catastrophic failure for the French. In early 1813, Prussia and Russia joined forces to fight against France, with the Austrians also joining this [[Sixth Coalition]] later in the year. In October 1813, a large Allied army defeated Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. The next year, the Allies launched an [[1814 campaign in France|invasion of France]] and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]]. The [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbons]] were [[Bourbon restoration|restored to power]] and the French lost most territories they had conquered since the Revolution. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and returned to lead the French government, only to find himself at war against [[War of the Seventh Coalition|another coalition]]. This new coalition decisively defeated him at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June. He surrendered to the British who imprisoned him on the remote island of [[Saint Helena]]. His death in 1821, at the age of 51, was received by shock and grief throughout Europe. In 1840, a million people witnessed his [[Retour des cendres|remains returning to Paris]], where they still reside at [[Les Invalides]].<ref>Roberts, A. ''Napoleon: A Life''.

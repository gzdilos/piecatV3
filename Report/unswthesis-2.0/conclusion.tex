\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Summarize what we have so far??
\end{itemize}

Users are not capable of understanding what type of user that they are. This means that the results that we have achieved may not be reliable enough to measure the performance of our algorithm. 

\section{Future Work}
 
Our algorithm only contains a few user types, these user types could be expanded into more specific categories. There could also be more work dedicated to making the user understand each user type so they they will be able to correctly select their user type that best defines themselves.

\begin{itemize}
\item Possible stuff to extend our thesis
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Proposal}\label{ch:proposal}

%Every semester, students ask their supervisor how to write their thesis,
%what the requirements are, and what to write in it.  
%This document tries to answer all such questions.

\section{Our Solution}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Discuss the proposal
  \item Outline differences and what we do compared to previous works
  \item explain what we want to do
\ldots
\end{itemize}

Our thesis aims to provide a more personlized view of Facebook's feed that is more adaptable to users. We do this through the introduction of user types in order to figure out what users actually want in their feed. We utilize the same tried and true algorithms used in ranking the feed but we incorporate user types and the weights that are produced from this type in order to make the feed more relevant to the user. This means that users will be provided with posts that they are more interested in at the top of their feed.
